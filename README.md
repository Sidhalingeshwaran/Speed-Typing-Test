# Speed-Typing-Test
A dynamic speed typing test web application that challenges users to type a random quote as quickly and accurately as possible. The project tracks the time taken and provides instant feedback on performance. It's a great demonstration of fetching data from an API, handling user input, and managing a timer with JavaScript.
